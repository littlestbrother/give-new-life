					<h3 class="major">Our Vision</h3>
					<p>Unlocking the potential of every forsaken child in Mexico through the love and teachings of Jesus alongside
						a transformative education and work ethic, ensuring them a brighter future.</p>

					<h3 class="major">Our Mission</h3>
					<p>To offer a lasting refuge for children who have endured abandonment, abuse, and orphanhood. To extend a
						temporary haven for those caught in court custody battles and guardianship disputes stemming from neglect,
						abuse, and abandonment. Ultimately, our mission is to mend these children's shattered lives through the
						boundless love of Jesus Christ.</p>

					<h3 class="major">Our History</h3>
					<strong>1972</strong><br />
					<p>Dr. John Cook, Ph.D. and Maria Lucia Cook, began their visits to an orphanage in rural central Mexico,
						located in the state of
						Michoacan. In addition to providing medical care to the ailing, they imparted valuable agricultural
						knowledge
						to the locals. Over the course of four years, the Cooks dedicated their summers to nurturing and tending to
						over 60 orphans in Michoacan.</p>

					<strong>1976</strong><br />
					<p>Upon learning of the passing of Gerard Stokes, the dedicated caretaker of the children in Michoacan whom
						Dr. Cook had visited, Dr. Cook received the distressing news that the ministry would cease operations
						permanently. In response, he made the selfless choice to relinquish his tenured position as a professor at
						New Mexico University and assume responsibility for the orphanage in economically disadvantaged rural
						Mexico.</p>

					<strong>~50 years later</strong><br />
					<p>More than 600 orphaned children have triumphed in establishing their own families and excelling in
						professional or technical careers. Each one was plucked from the brink of destruction, and many were saved
						from near-certain demise. Consequently, 16 churches have taken root, spreading the message of Jesus Christ
						to hundreds of thousands. Additionally, over 100,000 surgeries have been conducted free of charge for
						Mexico's most vulnerable populations, and John Cook himself has attended to over one million patients at his
						clinic.</p>

					<strong>Today</strong><br />
					<p>The GNL Orphanage & Clinic in Michoacan, Mexico, persists in its mission to serve the community. It is now
						under the capable stewardship of Dr. Cook's son and daughter-in-law, Josue and Karla Cook. They are
						steadfastly upholding Dr. Cook's legacy and fulfilling the will of our Heavenly Father. </p>

					<h3 class="major">Core Values</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>Love</strong><br />
						We hold the conviction that love serves as the primary and paramount catalyst for the recovery and
						metamorphosis of children who have endured abuse, neglect, and abandonment. Devoid of love, the reclamation
						of the joy pilfered from countless young souls remains an insurmountable task. Absent love, gaining the
						confidence of children who struggle to trust even themselves, let alone others, becomes an arduous endeavor.
						In the absence of love, rekindling the will to live that many children have relinquished due to their
						adverse circumstances is an unattainable goal. Without love, purpose falters, and without purpose, freedom
						remains elusive.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Patience</strong><br />It is often said that patience is the virtue of maintaining composure in the
						midst of adversity and moments of great need. When it comes to the care of children, patience is
						foundational. Transformation is not an instantaneous process. Therefore, patience becomes indispensable when
						tending to abandoned, abused, and orphaned children. We firmly believe in sowing seeds in the lives of these
						children, but just like a seed, growth and fruition take time. It is through patience that we witness these
						young lives undergoing remarkable transformation.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Perseverance</strong><br />
						We hold the conviction that perseverance paves the way to attaining our goals. As children of the Divine, we
						encounter various adversities in our journey through life. Yet, with steadfast determination, we find that
						our aspirations become attainable. Sadly, many parents have relinquished their belief in their children,
						contributing to the self-doubt that often plagues them. Demonstrating perseverance in our service to God
						signifies not only our faith in His transformative power within a child's life, but also our unwavering
						belief in the potential of our children. God did not beckon us to surrender; rather, He called us to persist
						in our faith in Him.
