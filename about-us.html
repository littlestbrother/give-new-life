					<h3 class="major">Our Mission</h3>
					<p>To provide a permanent home for children that have been
						abandoned, abused and orphaned. To provide a temporary
						home for children going through court custody and
						guardianship disputes caused by neglect, abuse, and
						abandonment. And above all, transforming children's broken lives with the love of Jesus Christ.</p>

					<h3 class="major">Our History</h3>
					<strong>1972</strong><br />
					<p>Dr. John Cook (Ph.D.) started to visit an orphanage in rural central Mexico in the state of
						Michoacan. As a doctor, he attended to the sick and taught locals how to improve their agricultural
						techniques. Dr. John Cook also cared for 60-plus orphans every summer in Michoacan for four years.</p>

					<strong>1976</strong><br />
					<p>Gerard Stokes the caretaker of the children in Michoacan, whom Dr. Cook visited, passed away. Dr.
						Cook was notified of the unfortunate event, and that the ministry was closing its doors permanently. So Dr.
						Cook decided to give up his tenured position as a professor at New Mexico University to take over the
						orphanage in rural impoverished Mexico.</p>

					<strong>~50 years later</strong><br />
					<p>Over 600 orphaned children became successful in forming families and finishing professional
						or technical careers. All were rescued from the claws of destruction and most were rescued from certain
						death. As a result- 16 churches have been planted, and hundreds of thousands have heard the message of Jesus
						Christ. Over
						100,000 surgeries have been performed for free for the least advantaged people of Mexico, and over one
						million patients attended John Cook's clinic personally.
					</p>

					<strong>Today</strong><br />
					<p>The GNL Orphanage & Clinic continues to serve the people of Michoacan Mexico, and is now operated by Dr. Cook's son and his wife. Josue & Karla Cook are
						continuing Josue's fathers legacy and our Heavenly Father's will.</p>

					<h3 class="major">Core Values</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>Love</strong><br />
						We believe that love is the main and most important tool for the restoration and transformation of children
						who have been victims of abuse, mistreatment, and abandonment. Without love, it is impossible to restore the
						stolen happiness of so many children. Without love, it is impossible to win the trust of children who do not
						trust themselves- much fewer others. Without love, it is impossible to re-establish the desire to live that
						many children have lost due to their unfavorable circumstances. Without love, there is no purpose, and
						without purpose, there is no freedom.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Patience</strong><br />
						It is said that patience is the virtue of keeping calm in the face of adversity and moments of need.
						Patience in the care of children is fundamental. Change does not happen overnight, and because of this-
						patience is vital when caring for abandoned, abused, and orphaned children. We believe in planting seeds in
						children's lives, but a seed takes time to grow and give fruit. Through patience, we will see little lives
						be transformed.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Perseverance</strong><br />
						We believe that perseverance allows you to reach your destination. As His (God's) children, we face all
						sorts of
						adversities in life. But with perseverance, our goals are within reach. So many parents have given up on
						children; this is why so many children often don't believe in themselves. Perseverance in our work for God
						means
						not only that we believe God can do a work in a child's life, but it also means that we believe in our
						children. God didn't call us to quit. He called us to persevere in Him.
